"""Capabilities a reader needs to deliver a callback.

A callback lists in ``requires`` what delivering it depends on. A tower that
does not know one of them leaves the callback untouched in the queue instead
of delivering it halfway; after an upgrade it is delivered normally. This
replaces bumping a record version whenever route semantics change.
